## Rock Paper Scissors
Simple Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Description
Simple Rock Paper Scissors game made to be played in the browser console. Note that there is no display, the game is played entirely through the console and user prompts. The user can select rock/paper/scissors, the computer will make a random selection, and then console.log a message saying who won or if it was a tie. The game can be started by running play_game() in the browser console, and then using the prompts to input your move. A message will display for each round, and the full game is the best out of 5. An error message will display if the user types in an invalid move.

## Why?
The point of this project was to practice writing basic JavaScript functions by making a simple game. Since the focus of this small project was practicing basic JavaScript functions and not DOM manipulation, there is intentionally no display for the game.
